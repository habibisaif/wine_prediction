# White-Wine Quality Prediction
Predictive data modelling is one of many ways of conducting data analysis, to understand and forecast the probability of future events. It is often beneficial in fields such as finance, marketing, sales, healthcare, and more. This is a self-project by me to explore some of many prediction models in the data-science related areas of research. This project is conducted by comparing several prediction model to find the best use of the model corresponding with a spesific type of data. The data used are [The Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) presented in UCI Machine Learning repository.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## The purpose of the project
This project are conducted with a purpose of determining what prediction model are best-suited for the data. The data are equipped with sets of features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, residual sugar, etc. with the 'quality' data as labels. 

### Methods Used
With set of features stated before. It is important to really dived in to the data and see what are the features that really mattered and give more influence to the quality of the Wine in general. With subset of Features that are influencial to the Quality of Wine, we can then use some statistical model to make a prediction model to predict the quality of Wine given the unique Features of flavor.
In this project we use some method such as :
* Exporatory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling (LogisticRegression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, Perceptron Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Decent, and Decision Tree)

### Technologies
The code used in this project are written in Python Programming Language in Jupyter Notebook platform.
