# White-Wine Quality Prediction
Predictive data modelling is one of many ways of conducting data analysis, to understand and forecast the probability of future events. It is often beneficial in fields such as finance, marketing, sales, healthcare, and more. This is a self-project by me to explore some of many prediction models in the data-science related areas of research. This project is conducted by comparing several prediction model to find the best use of the model corresponding with a spesific type of data. The data used are [The Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) presented in UCI Machine Learning repository.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## The purpose of the project
This project are conducted with a purpose of determining what prediction model are best-suited for the data. The data are equipped with sets of features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, residual sugar, etc. with the 'quality' data as labels. 

### Methods Used
With set of features stated before. It is important to really dived in to the data and see what are the features that really mattered and give more influence to the quality of the Wine in general. With subset of Features that are influencial to the Quality of Wine, we can then use some statistical model to make a prediction model to predict the quality of Wine given the unique Features of flavor.
In this project we use some method such as :
* Exporatory Data Analysis
* Prediction model (Logistic Regression,   
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* R 
* Python
* D3
* PostGres, MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML
* JavaScript
* etc. 

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
